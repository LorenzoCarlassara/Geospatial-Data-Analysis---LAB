The provided time series are real data made available by ARPA Veneto, the regional agency for environment protection. The whole dataset
is composed by measurements from several boreholes each identified by a numeric ID

The developped script can be more accurate in some boreholes than other, due to the variety in the samples distribution between different
time series. Considering clustering them could help Including more information about the data may be helpful, for example adding some
layers could help find a stronger pattern on the behaviour.
A proposal for further analysis may be the implementation of Linearized LS on the hyperparameters and also the implementation of Kriging
method. Furthermore, a comparison of the performance of different technique or different boreholes with evaluation metrics (eg R-squared,
R-squared adj, AIC, BIC)
